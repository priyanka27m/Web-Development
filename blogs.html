<h2>Colourful Festivities Of Mysore Dasara</h2>
<p><i>September 24, 2021     By Neha S</i><br>
<b>The grandeur of Karnataka can be witnessed in its full glory during the Mysore Dasara festivities. This 10-day festival is celebrated with great pomp and show, attracting tourists from far and wide. With magnificent processions, cultural events, fairs, and exhibitions, Mysuru Dasara is India’s most extraordinary Dussehra celebration. The festival is celebrated during Navratri and reaches a grand finale on Vijayadashmi. Whether you are a religious soul or love to explore different cultures and regions, Mysuru Dasara will delight you to the core.<br><br>
Mysuru was once called ‘Mahishur,’ as it is believed to be the place where Goddess Chamundeshwari (a form of Durga) killed the buffalo-headed demon, Mahishasura. Since then, the nine days have been celebrated with much fervour.<br><br>The Jambu Savari or the Elephant procession is one of the most prominent events of this festival. During this procession, 12 trained elephants adorned with colourful attire are taken around the streets. One of them carries Chamundeshwari’s idol atop a golden mandap. The procession starts from the Mysore Palace to Bannimantap. Performances like traditional dances, musicals, and displays of swordsmanship can be witnessed throughout the procession – indeed a sight to behold. As it travels through the city streets, it spreads zeal and joy throughout the city.<b></p>
